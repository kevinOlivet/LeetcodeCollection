  ## 274. H-Index
 https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/description/

 Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.

 According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

 Example 1:
 Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
 Output: 3
 Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
 Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

 Example 2:
 Input: citations = [1,3,1]
 Output: 1

 ## 88. Merge Sorted Array
 https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150

 You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

 Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

 The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

 Example 1:
 Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
 Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
 Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
 The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

 Example 2:
 Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
 Output: [1]
 Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
 The result of the merge is [1].

 Example 3:
 Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
 Output: [1]
 Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
 The result of the merge is [1].
 Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

 ## 27. Remove Element
 https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150

 Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

 Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

 Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
 Return k.
 Custom Judge:

 The judge will test your solution with the following code:

 int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
 int val = ...; // Value to remove
 int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                             // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

 int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

 assert k == expectedNums.length;
 sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
 for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
     assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
 }
 If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

 Example 1:
 Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
 Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
 Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
 It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
 
 Example 2:
 Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
 Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
 Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
 Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
 It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

 ## 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
 https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150

 Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

 Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

 Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
 Return k.
 Custom Judge:

 The judge will test your solution with the following code:

 int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
 int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

 int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

 assert k == expectedNums.length;
 for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
     assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
 }
 If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

 Example 1:
 Input: nums = [1,1,2]
 Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
 Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
 It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

 Example 2:
 Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
 Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
 Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
 It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

 ## 169. Majority Element
 https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150

 Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
 The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

 Example 1:
 Input: nums = [3,2,3]
 Output: 3

 Example 2:
 Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
 Output: 2

 Constraints:
 n == nums.length
 1 <= n <= 5 * 104
 -109 <= nums[i] <= 109

 Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?

 ## 189. Rotate Array
 https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150

 Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

 Example 1:
 Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
 Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
 Explanation:
 rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
 rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
 rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

 Example 2:
 Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
 Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
 Explanation:
 rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
 rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]

 Constraints:
 1 <= nums.length <= 105
 -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
 0 <= k <= 105

 Follow up:

 Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem.
 Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

 ## 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II, Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock 2
 https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150

 You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

 On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

 Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

 Example 1:
 Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
 Output: 7
 Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
 Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
 Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

 Example 2:
 Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
 Output: 4
 Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
 Total profit is 4.

 Example 3:
 Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
 Output: 0
 Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
