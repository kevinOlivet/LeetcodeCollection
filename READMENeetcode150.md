 ## 36. Valid Sudoku
 https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/description/

 Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

 Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
 Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
 Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
 Note:

 A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
 Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

 Example 1:
 Input: board =
 [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
 ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
 ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
 ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
 ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
 ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
 ,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
 ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
 ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
 Output: true

 Example 2:
 Input: board =
 [["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
 ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
 ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
 ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
 ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
 ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
 ,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
 ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
 ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
 Output: false
 Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

 ## 42. Trapping Rain Water
 https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/description/

 Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

 Example 1:
 Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
 Output: 6
 Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

 Example 2:
 Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
 Output: 9

 ## 567. Permutation in String
 https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/description/

 Given two strings s1 and s2, return true if s2 contains a
 permutation
  of s1, or false otherwise.

 In other words, return true if one of s1's permutations is the substring of s2.

 Example 1:
 Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidbaooo"
 Output: true
 Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").

 Example 2:
 Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidboaoo"
 Output: false

 ## 239. Sliding Window Maximum
 https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/description/

 You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

 Return the max sliding window.

 Example 1:
 Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
 Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]
 Explanation:
 Window position                Max
 ---------------               -----
 [1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
  1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
  1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
  1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
  1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
  1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7

 Example 2:
 Input: nums = [1], k = 1
 Output: [1]
