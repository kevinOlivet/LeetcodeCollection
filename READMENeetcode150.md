 ## 36. Valid Sudoku
 https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/description/

 Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

 Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
 Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
 Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
 Note:

 A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
 Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

 Example 1:
 Input: board =
 [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
 ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
 ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
 ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
 ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
 ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
 ,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
 ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
 ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
 Output: true

 Example 2:
 Input: board =
 [["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
 ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
 ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
 ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
 ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
 ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
 ,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
 ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
 ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
 Output: false
 Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

 ## 875. Koko Eating Bananas
 https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/description/

 Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.

 Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

 Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

 Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.

 Example 1:
 Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
 Output: 4

 Example 2:
 Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
 Output: 30

 Example 3:
 Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
 Output: 23

 ## 981. Time Based Key-Value Store
 https://leetcode.com/problems/time-based-key-value-store/description/

 Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple values for the same key at different time stamps and retrieve the key's value at a certain timestamp.

 Implement the TimeMap class:

 TimeMap() Initializes the object of the data structure.
 void set(String key, String value, int timestamp) Stores the key key with the value value at the given time timestamp.
 String get(String key, int timestamp) Returns a value such that set was called previously, with timestamp_prev <= timestamp. If there are multiple such values, it returns the value associated with the largest timestamp_prev. If there are no values, it returns "".


 Example 1:
 Input
 ["TimeMap", "set", "get", "get", "set", "get", "get"]
 [[], ["foo", "bar", 1], ["foo", 1], ["foo", 3], ["foo", "bar2", 4], ["foo", 4], ["foo", 5]]
 Output
 [null, null, "bar", "bar", null, "bar2", "bar2"]

 Explanation
 TimeMap timeMap = new TimeMap();
 timeMap.set("foo", "bar", 1);  // store the key "foo" and value "bar" along with timestamp = 1.
 timeMap.get("foo", 1);         // return "bar"
 timeMap.get("foo", 3);         // return "bar", since there is no value corresponding to foo at timestamp 3 and timestamp 2, then the only value is at timestamp 1 is "bar".
 timeMap.set("foo", "bar2", 4); // store the key "foo" and value "bar2" along with timestamp = 4.
 timeMap.get("foo", 4);         // return "bar2"
 timeMap.get("foo", 5);         // return "bar2"

 NOTE!!: - All the timestamps timestamp of set are strictly increasing.

 ## 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays
 NOTE: binary search didn't work, but O(m + n) works
 https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/description/

 Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

 The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

 Example 1:
 Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
 Output: 2.00000
 Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.

 Example 2:
 Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
 Output: 2.50000
 Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.

 ## 138. Copy List with Random Pointer
 https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/description/

 NOTE: Can be solved in two passes or using func cloneGraph with dfs

 A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or null.

 Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.

 For example, if there are two nodes X and Y in the original list, where X.random --> Y, then for the corresponding two nodes x and y in the copied list, x.random --> y.

 Return the head of the copied linked list.

 The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:

 val: an integer representing Node.val
 random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) that the random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.
 Your code will only be given the head of the original linked list.

 Example 1:
 Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
 Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]

 Example 2:
 Input: head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
 Output: [[1,1],[2,1]]

 Example 3:
 Input: head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
 Output: [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]

 ## 2. Add Two Numbers
 https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/

 You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

 You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

 Example 1:
 Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
 Output: [7,0,8]
 Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

 Example 2:
 Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
 Output: [0]

 Example 3:
 Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
 Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

 ## 146. LRU Cache
 https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/description/

 Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.

 Implement the LRUCache class:

 LRUCache(int capacity) Initialize the LRU cache with positive size capacity.
 int get(int key) Return the value of the key if the key exists, otherwise return -1.
 void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, add the key-value pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity from this operation, evict the least recently used key.
 The functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.

 Example 1:
 Input
 ["LRUCache", "put", "put", "get", "put", "get", "put", "get", "get", "get"]
 [[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]
 Output
 [null, null, null, 1, null, -1, null, -1, 3, 4]

 Explanation
 LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(2);
 lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
 lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}
 lRUCache.get(1);    // return 1
 lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
 lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)
 lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}
 lRUCache.get(1);    // return -1 (not found)
 lRUCache.get(3);    // return 3
 lRUCache.get(4);    // return 4
