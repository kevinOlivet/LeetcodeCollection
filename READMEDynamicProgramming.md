## 494. Target Sum
 https://leetcode.com/problems/target-sum/

 You are given an integer array nums and an integer target.

 You want to build an expression out of nums by adding one of the symbols '+' and '-' before each integer in nums and then concatenate all the integers.

 For example, if nums = [2, 1], you can add a '+' before 2 and a '-' before 1 and concatenate them to build the expression "+2-1".
 Return the number of different expressions that you can build, which evaluates to target.

 Example 1:
 Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], target = 3
 Output: 5
 Explanation: There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.
 -1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
 +1 - 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
 +1 + 1 - 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
 +1 + 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 = 3
 +1 + 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 = 3

 Example 2:
 Input: nums = [1], target = 1
 Output: 1

## 983. Minimum Cost For Tickets
 https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-for-tickets/

 You have planned some train traveling one year in advance. The days of the year in which you will travel are given as an integer array days. Each day is an integer from 1 to 365.

 Train tickets are sold in three different ways:

 a 1-day pass is sold for costs[0] dollars,
 a 7-day pass is sold for costs[1] dollars, and
 a 30-day pass is sold for costs[2] dollars.
 The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.

 For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
 Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days.

 Example 1:
 Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
 Output: 11
 Explanation: For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
 On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
 On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
 On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
 In total, you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.

 Example 2:
 Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
 Output: 17
 Explanation: For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
 On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
 On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
 In total, you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.

## 91. Decode Ways
 https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/description/

 A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:

 'A' -> "1"
 'B' -> "2"
 ...
 'Z' -> "26"
 To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, "11106" can be mapped into:

 "AAJF" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
 "KJF" with the grouping (11 10 6)
 Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because "06" cannot be mapped into 'F' since "6" is different from "06".

 Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.

 The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

 Example 1:
 Input: s = "12"
 Output: 2
 Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).

 Example 2:
 Input: s = "226"
 Output: 3
 Explanation: "226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).

 Example 3:
 Input: s = "06"
 Output: 0
 Explanation: "06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero ("6" is different from "06").

## 198. House Robber
 https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/description/

 // Dynamic Programming

 You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

 Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

 Example 1:
 Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
 Output: 4
 Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
 Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

 Example 2:
 Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
 Output: 12
 Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
 Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

## 97. Interleaving String
 https://leetcode.com/problems/interleaving-string/description/

 Given strings s1, s2, and s3, find whether s3 is formed by an interleaving of s1 and s2.

 An interleaving of two strings s and t is a configuration where s and t are divided into n and m
 substrings
  respectively, such that:

 s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn
 t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm
 |n - m| <= 1
 The interleaving is s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ... or t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...
 Note: a + b is the concatenation of strings a and b.

 Example 1:
 Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac"
 Output: true
 Explanation: One way to obtain s3 is:
 Split s1 into s1 = "aa" + "bc" + "c", and s2 into s2 = "dbbc" + "a".
 Interleaving the two splits, we get "aa" + "dbbc" + "bc" + "a" + "c" = "aadbbcbcac".
 Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.

 Example 2:
 Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbbaccc"
 Output: false
 Explanation: Notice how it is impossible to interleave s2 with any other string to obtain s3.

 Example 3:
 Input: s1 = "", s2 = "", s3 = ""
 Output: true

## 213. House Robber II
 https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/description/

 // Dynamic Programming

 You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

 Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

 Example 1:
 Input: nums = [2,3,2]
 Output: 3
 Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.

 Example 2:
 Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
 Output: 4
 Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
 Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

 Example 3:
 Input: nums = [1,2,3]
 Output: 3
